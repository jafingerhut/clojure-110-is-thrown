# clojure-110-is-thrown

A minimal project demonstrating a difference between Clojure 1.9.0 and
Clojure 1.10.0.


## Usage

These tests all pass:

```bash
% lein with-profile +1.9 test
```

These tests fail, apparently on the test expression starting with `(is
(thrown-with-msg? ...` in file `core_test.clj`:

```bash
% lein with-profile +1.10 test
```
